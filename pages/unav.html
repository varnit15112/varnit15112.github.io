		<p class="sectionHeading"><strong>RESEARCH</strong></p><br>


		<p><strong>1. Market Research</strong></p>
		<p class="contentTextDown">
			Self-service interactive devices are becoming more prevalent in our daily life and are continuously evolving, these self-service kiosks can be found in fast food restaurants, used as ATMs and acr as check-in stations at airports. While self-serving kiosks are quickly replacing manual service, the importance of accessibility for all consumers is recognized by the society. The Americans with Disabilities Act has required companies to follow regulations that ensure equal access for people with different types of disabilities. According to the ADA, there are certain requirements for technologies to grant people with disabilities with the same access to interactive technology and data, such as enough open space, high and side reach range. <br><br>

			Analyzing the current NCR kiosk products for accessibility features reveals many intentional design choices. For NCR SelfServe checkout hardware, wheelchair height and reach have been considered for easier accessibility. These checkout hardware products also include UNav keypads, integrated headphone jacks, volume control, and tactile keys to assist users with physical, hearing, and visual impairments.  Specific accessibility considerations have been implemented for NCR ATMs, such as universal tactile features for ATM function keys and a touchscreen designed for users with visual impairment.  NCR ATMs also include interactive teller features, which allow users to communicate with a remote teller for assistance. <br><br>


			NCR has approached accessibility design with the inclusion of uNav, and it is important to understand how this fits into the context of the kiosk manufacturing market.  Out of NCR, Rockwell Collins , Toshiba, Fujitsu, IER SAS, and SITA, only NCR and IER SAS include physical hardware button controls as part of their accessibility design solution. All other manufacturers mentioned either do not include accessibility design or it is implemented within the software, requiring users to interact with a touch screen.  Since many manufacturers allow for custom kiosk software often times accessibility features and design may be overlooked entirely, especially when no physical buttons are implemented in the kiosk. <br><br>

			Though uNav has been found to improve kiosk interaction, the lack of uniform accessibility design between kiosk manufacturers can be and has been problematic for users.  It has been suggested that kiosk manufacturers work together on kiosk accessibility to mitigate these issues. This is an interesting proposition considering that NCR’s patented uNav can be bought as a standalone unit to be implemented in other brands of kiosks.<br><br><br></p>


			<p><strong>2. Literature Review</strong></p>
			<p class="contentTextDown">
				There is an ever-growing field of research to suggest best practices for accessibility within digital design, yet there seems to be a lesser focus on integrating accessibility into kiosks. We have sourced, reviewed, and synthesized several prior research papers that either touch on kiosk accessibility or an applicable field (e.g. web design).<br><br>


				Some of the key takeaways from literature review are:<br>
				1. While we will not be focusing on the idea of mechanical adjustments, but the idea that a system can recognize and adapt to its user is something to be considered.<br>

				2. Many models exist that can be good reference points if we need to do an overall accessibility test of kiosks, or understanding how other kiosks have improved physical accessibility.<br>

				3. A good contextual enquiry can be very insightful - they are not only able to correct the user flow but are also able to add additional features.<br><br>


				<br><br></p>

				<p><strong>3. Task Analysis</strong></p>
				<p class="contentTextDown">

					‍As a starting point, we decided to first complete a task analysis of the XK32 kiosk. This allowed us to familiarize ourselves with the overall feel of the system, understand interactions from a high level, and prompted us to understand the limitations of the system for those with physical disabilities. The task analysis begins from the moment that a user approaches the kiosk with the intent to order a meal and ends with the completion of the interaction, when they pay for and receive a receipt for their order. Our contact at NCR was unable to provide wireframes to us due to confidentiality concerns, but were able to provide screen grabs of every screen.<br><br>

					It is important to note that the specific information displayed on the kiosk depends entirely on the context in which it is used. For instance, if the kiosk is located in a certain restaurant it will only display information pertinent to that restaurant. If it is located in a food court, however, it will display options for several restaurants. Therefore, the task analysis we created represents a general overview of the interactions a user will experience, separated by what is experienced in a food court-type of context from a dedicated-restaurant context.<br><br>

					<strong>Infromation Goal</strong><br>
				We conducted a task analysis to primarily learn about the user flow and the decision-making process of a user as they interact with the XK32 kiosk. The ordering process on the XK32 kiosk can involve many steps from start to completion, so it was necessary to understand how these steps connected to one another and how a user typically navigates from the start screen to order completion, and follows them during the entire ordering process. By understanding how the system currently operates, we were able to form a baseline on which we could develop further research efforts.</p>

				<img src="unav-task.png" class="middleImg" width="100%"><br><br>


				<p><strong>4. Observation</strong></p>
				<p class="contentTextDown">

					‍In order to better understand how users interact with the current system, our team decided to observe users interacting with the kiosk during lunch hour at NCR. Though our target user group consists of those with disabilities, we found it important to observe all users who might interact with our system. Any design that targets those with physical disabilities will also affect how others interact with the system.<br><br>



					<strong>Infromation Goal</strong><br><br>
					Our goal with observation was mostly exploratory and built off of our task analysis. The task analysis we completed served as the base to form this observation study. All though the task analysis informed us of the overall flow a user must take to complete a transaction, it did not highlight any pain points or inform any subjective feelings the users might have about the system. We wanted to determine if users experienced difficulty with any point of the ordering process due to usability issues.<br>
				Additionally, we aimed to explore baseline data on the learnability of the kiosk interface. In short, we wanted to know how a novice user interacts with the system compared to a user that has been familiar with the system for some time. We felt this was an important step in deciding how users of different experience levels interacted with the system, and we rationalized that we could use this information to inform design decisions in subsequent sections.</p>

				<img src="unav-observations.jpg" class="middleImg" width="30%"><br><br>


				<p><strong>4. Semi-Structure Interview</strong></p>
				<p class="contentTextDown">

					‍Our team decided to conduct a semi-structured one-on-one interview as our first research method involving a physically disabled user within the problem space. A one-on-one interview was logistically easier to setup than a focus group and allowed for a very personal conversation compared to other research methods. Using a semi-structured interview allowed our team to answer specific questions we had, but still explore the problem space by having an open discussion. We held our interview in the Usability Lab in Georgia Tech and it lasted about an hour.<br><br>


					<strong>Infromation Goal</strong><br><br>
					Our main information goal from this research method was to gain insight into our user group’s wants and needs regarding digital technology accessibility. After conducting our observation it was clear that the kiosk has general usability issues, but we needed to focus on select issues affecting physically disabled users. Another goal was to understand the limitations of wheelchair users during point of sale transactions due to their seated position. Our understanding prior to the interview was that not all kiosks were designed with wheelchair height in mind for usability.

					Beyond this, we wanted to determine specific pain points that our interviewee had with kiosk accessibility. We also wanted to know what public technologies they currently found helpful, whether or not it was implemented in point of sale kiosks. We also went into the interview with the idea that we could potentially narrow down our user group if given the opportunity.<br><br></p>

					<img src="unav-interview.JPG" class="middleImg" width="80%"><br><br>

					<p><strong>5. Survey</strong></p>
					<p class="contentTextDown">

						‍We chose an online survey as a research method to collect data largely because of its ability to collect data from a substantial set of users in a short time. Our preference was to do an in depth cognitive walkthrough of NCR’s system, but due to the lack of sourced participants this was unable to be completed before the research needed to be completed. Unfortunately, NCR was not able to fund in person interviews which provides less incentive for our user group. Also, we hoped to have our IRB protocol approved in time to source participants from Georgia Tech labs, but this was not the case.  Ultimately, we used an online survey as an alternative due to lack of participants willing to meet in person.<br><br>


						<strong>Infromation Goal</strong><br><br>



					A main information goal of using a survey was to learn what users with disabilities like and dislike about point of sale kiosks. Another goal was to learn how users’ disabilities hinder specific interactions with a kiosk. Based on our previous research methods we decided another goal was to learn about common frustrations at each stage of the process of completing a checkout. A secondary information goal was to refine our user group by recognizing common problem areas and patterns. Another secondary information goal was to determine if certain users prefer tactile interaction versus touch screen and for completing what tasks.</p>

					<p class="sectionHeading"><strong>FINDINGS</strong></p>

					<p class="contentTextDown">
						Our research methods provided valuable insight into who our user group is, what common points of frustration and difficulty they with interactive kiosks (and more generally, digital technology), and, perhaps most importantly, resulted in an informed design direction for the next part of this project. After every research method was completed our team met to discuss the findings and how we would want to pursue further research methods.<br><br>

						<img src="unav-affinity.png" class="middleImg" width="80%"><br><br>
						
					</p>

					<p><strong>Themes</strong></p>
					<p class="contentTextDown">

						From the task analysis, observation study, interview, and survey, we had a general idea of where users (both with and without physical impairments) we're likely to experience problems. A few of the most straight-forward problems, and likely the most easily remedied, were:<br><br>

						<ol class="contentTextDown">

							<li>Users did not notice that alternate methods of interacting with the kiosk were available.
								<ul>
									<li>Nearly all of the users from the observation did not notice that the uNav existed at all. This is likely the result of the physical device being out of the line of sight of the user as they approach the kiosk</li>
									
									<li>The initial welcome screen indicates that the user should “Tap anywhere to begin,” but does not mention the uNav system.</li>
									
									<li>Though many users will never have any reason, or interest, in using the uNav, the lack of recognition of the feature might dissuade those with physical disabilities from approaching the kiosk in the first place.</li>
								</ul>
							</li><br>
									
							<li>Users did not notice that there were more options to certain menu items due to the scroll bar being too light in contrast compared to the background.
								<ul>
									<li>Another takeaway from the observation study revealed that users would skip over certain menu options if they weren’t displayed on the screen immediately. Many items weren’t immediately visible, and instead were further down the page and had to be scrolled to.</li>

									<li>They very light grey of the scroll bar likely went unnoticed when paired with the white background.</li> 
								</ul>
							</li><br>
							
							<li>Certain areas of the screen are challenging for users with physical impairments to reach or see from where they are seated.
								<ul>
									<li>According to information gathered from our survey, a common problem that users faced was reaching areas of the screen.</li>

									<li>Further, from their seated position, many were unable to effectively see the upper areas of the screen to know what information was being displayed.</li>
								</ul>
							</li><br>

							<li>Users became frustrated with the slow movement and interaction controls of the uNav device.
									<ul><li>Users noted that they felt the uNav was cumbersome to use - both in how slowly it tracked across the screen and how some interactions required significant dexterity to successfully perform. For instance, in order to scroll down the screen, the user must place the cursor on the scroll bar and hold down two buttons at the same time (the enter button and up or down) to facilitate scrolling.</li></ul>
							</li><br>

							<li>Users were often unaware of how to add an item to cart before checkout.
								<ul><li>
									Many times, users would go to check out only to find that their cart was empty. They would then be presented with the option to tap “x” to return to their order, but many were unsure if that would cancel their order outright.</li></ul>
							</li><br>

							Other insights were less direct in their relevance to the XK32 kiosk, but were of enough significance to be considered for future design directions. Namely:<br><br>


							<li>Users want to remain independent, and not made to feel “special.”
									<ul><li>This was explicitly stated during the interview and was an underlying subject from many survey respondents. In developing design solutions, it will be important to address how an accessibility feature will be perceived and, if possible, how it might be used universally.</li></ul>
							</li><br>
							
							<li>Feedback is important.
									<ul><li>Many users with physical impairments also suffer from lack of feeling difficult in the movement of their extremities. As such, means of feedback other than visual will be considered.</li></ul>
							</li><br>


								</ol>

							<p class="contentTextDown">

							‍Our group started this phase of the project by brainstorming different design concepts with users’ limitations and needs and design implications we analyzed from previous section in mind. We finalized various features and ideas from brainstorm session into three abstract design concepts that covers different ranges of potential users of kiosks. Sketches and descriptions were created for each concepts for assessment by experts and users for feedback.</p><br>

The app will use the phone’s camera and computer vision to recognize parts and prompt the user with questions to help them discover and fix the problem. If the user cannot diagnose or fix the problem themselves, they can use a paid function to connect with an expert, who will be available by video stream and an onscreen “drawing” feature.</p>

									‍Northstar is a concept that redefines what a public-use bicycle repair station can be. It provides users with free-to-use tools, resources, and has the added element of an interactive screen that can guide users through general repair processes. It is designed to be integrated with Google Maps to make discovering repair station locations more accessible. Further, it leverages community input in the form of users reporting issues that inform others of the available tools/resource.</p>

							<p><strong>Concept Evaluation</strong></p>
							<p class="contentTextDown">
								‍To test our design ideas, we created another survey to reach out to a wider audience. To achieve the same, we shared the survey not only to bicycling communities but also on famous facebook, reddit pages. This survey focused on Learnability, Efficiency, Memorability, Errors, Satisfaction as well as feature level evaluations. We wanted to know which features seemed attractive and useful to users and which ones felt obsolete to them. We received 44 responses and evaluated which features overcame initial pain points and were appreciated by the users.

						<div class="container">
							<p class="sectionHeading"><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>


							<p class="contentTextDown">

								‍Our final solution contains most parts of Concept 1 - Sherpa and one part of Concept 2 - NorthStar. We realized that not a lot of users will want to pay for an expert's advice, they would rather take their bicycle to the shop; so we removed the expert advice feature. We also noticed that users do not carry tools all the time so we integrated the Repair Station Locator feature from NorthStart to display public repair stations.<br><br><br>


								<img src="sherpa-main.jpg" class="middleImg" width="50%"><br><br>					
							</p><br>


							<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
							<p class="contentTextDown">


								<div class="row">

									<div class="col-lg-4 align-items-center">
										<p class="contentTextDown" align="center"><strong>1. User Profile</strong></p>
										<img src="sherpa-feature-1.png" class="middleImg phoneImage" width="80%">
										<p class="contentTextDown"><br>
										‍The user can set up a custom profile that will allow them to track their use of the app, maintain a maintenance schedule, and connect to the activity app “Strava.” This fits into the idea of Sherpa being an integrated product, and leverages Strava’s capabilities for activity tracking.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-lg-4 align-items-center">
										<p class="contentTextDown" align="center"><strong>2. Bicycle Selection</strong></p>
										<img src="sherpa-feature-2.png" class="middleImg phoneImage" width="80%">
										<p class="contentTextDown"><br>
										‍This details the type of bicycle(s) that the user has, and allows them to input custom components. As repairs might be different based on the type of bicycle a user has, a “bicycle profile” can be created. These bicycles will be displayed on the home screen, and the user can easily cycle through them.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-lg-4 align-items-center">
										<p class="contentTextDown" align="center"><strong>3. Diagnostic Tool</strong></p>
										<img src="sherpa-feature-3.png" class="middleImg phoneImage" width="80%">
										<p class="contentTextDown"><br>
										‍The diagnostic tool is a feature which helps users determine the problem with their bicycle. Once the option is selected, the user will be prompted with a series of questions. The question flow will depend on the answers which will help the user narrow down on a specific problem. The users who already know the issue with their bicycle can choose to skip the diagnostic tool.</p>
									</div>

								</div>


								<div class="row">

									<div class="col-lg-4 align-items-center">
										<p class="contentTextDown" align="center"><strong>4. Repair Guide</strong></p>
										<img src="sherpa-feature-4.png" class="middleImg phoneImage" width="80%">
										<p class="contentTextDown"><br>
										‍Once the user knows the problem with their bicycle, they will use the repair guide to perform repairs. The repair guide is a step by step process that tells users what to do. For each step, the user will see a small visual of the repair. We understand that the user might have to use both their hands to perform repairs and it is often not feasible to physically touch the phone or even look at it. Owing to these concerns, the repair guide has two audio elements: (1) An audio guide which speaks the step that is to be performed (2) Once the step is completed, the user can speak “Next” which moves the system to the next repair step</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-lg-4 align-items-center">
										<p class="contentTextDown" align="center"><strong>5. Part Identification</strong></p>
										<img src="sherpa-feature-5.png" class="middleImg phoneImage" width="80%">
										<p class="contentTextDown"><br>
										‍The part identification tool is used when the user can not recognize a certain part mentioned in the repair guide. Sherpa uses augmented reality to help the user identify the part. The user scans their bicycle using their phone camera and the selected part is highlighted when hovered upon. The feasibility of the augmented reality tool is supported by the fact that all bike manufacturers have 3D models of their bicycles which can be leveraged to support this tool.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-lg-4 align-items-center">
										<p class="contentTextDown" align="center"><strong>6. Repair Station Locator</strong></p>
										<img src="sherpa-feature-6.png" class="middleImg phoneImage" width="80%">
										<p class="contentTextDown"><br>
										‍The repair station Locator is used in cases when the user doesn’t have the required tools to perform the repair process. They can use this tool is used in combination with Google Maps to direct the user to the nearest public repair station. The application also shows a list of tools available at any given repair station so that users can decide if a particular repair station has all the tools they need or not.</p>
									</div>

								</div><br><br>



								<p><strong>Prototype</strong></p>
								<p class="contentTextDown">
									We will first need to validate our design concept with our users on the basis of usability and adequacy in diagnosing problems and the repair process. Further, we will want to test different methods of interaction to determine what users find most appropriate while in the context of repairing a bicycle.<br><br>


									Below is a mid-fidelity prototype that was built with Sketch, and it will be used to gauge initial feedback. We chose to produce a mid-fidelity prototype as a starting point, as it will be easy to refine and iterate without getting bogged down by aesthetic and low-level detail considerations. However, given our short time to complete this project, we have started developing an aesthetic direction as well, of which a few core screens are visualized in the previous section.
								</p>


								<img src="sherpa-proto-2.png" class="middleImg" width="80%"><br><br>					
								<p class="contentTextDown">
									Our users will likely be implementing our mobile app on a smartphone, and as such, we have used a program (Sketch) that will allow us to push the interactive prototype to an iPhone. We want to gauge the effectiveness of this prototype at discovering and solving problems with maintenance, and will include enough information in the prototype to allow the participant to have a sense of how this will help them with the aforementioned tasks. <br>
								Though the entire prototype has been built out to show the majority of screen interactions, some paths of the prototype are more valuable to our purposes of user testing than others. For our purposes, we will identify a task (in this case, it is a flat tire) that we want the user to complete, and ask them to first diagnose the problem until they discover it and the app confirms that this is the correct problem. Within the diagnosis process, they will utilize the part identification feature to recognize and confirm that their tire has low air pressure. Once confirmed, they will indicate that they do not have the appropriate tools to complete the task, and will then be directed to the repair station locator. From here, they will identify which repair station to use, then determine if it has the appropriate tools to inflate their tire. Finally, they will be walked through a simplified version of the repair. </p><br>
