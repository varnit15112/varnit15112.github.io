	<!-- 	<strong class="topHeading unavColor">Market Research</strong>
		<p class="contentTextDown">
			Self-service interactive devices are becoming more prevalent in our daily life and are continuously evolving, these self-service kiosks can be found in fast food restaurants, used as ATMs and acr as check-in stations at airports. While self-serving kiosks are quickly replacing manual service, the importance of accessibility for all consumers is recognized by the society. The Americans with Disabilities Act has required companies to follow regulations that ensure equal access for people with different types of disabilities. According to the ADA, there are certain requirements for technologies to grant people with disabilities with the same access to interactive technology and data, such as enough open space, high and side reach range. <br><br>

			Analyzing the current NCR kiosk products for accessibility features reveals many intentional design choices. For NCR SelfServe checkout hardware, wheelchair height and reach have been considered for easier accessibility. These checkout hardware products also include UNav keypads, integrated headphone jacks, volume control, and tactile keys to assist users with physical, hearing, and visual impairments.  Specific accessibility considerations have been implemented for NCR ATMs, such as universal tactile features for ATM function keys and a touchscreen designed for users with visual impairment.  NCR ATMs also include interactive teller features, which allow users to communicate with a remote teller for assistance. <br>
			NCR has approached accessibility design with the inclusion of uNav, and it is important to understand how this fits into the context of the kiosk manufacturing market.  Out of NCR, Rockwell Collins , Toshiba, Fujitsu, IER SAS, and SITA, only NCR and IER SAS include physical hardware button controls as part of their accessibility design solution. All other manufacturers mentioned either do not include accessibility design or it is implemented within the software, requiring users to interact with a touch screen.  Since many manufacturers allow for custom kiosk software often times accessibility features and design may be overlooked entirely, especially when no physical buttons are implemented in the kiosk. <br><br>
			Though uNav has been found to improve kiosk interaction, the lack of uniform accessibility design between kiosk manufacturers can be and has been problematic for users.  It has been suggested that kiosk manufacturers work together on kiosk accessibility to mitigate these issues. This is an interesting proposition considering that NCR’s patented uNav can be bought as a standalone unit to be implemented in other brands of kiosks.<br><br><br></p> -->


			<strong class="topHeading unavColor">Literature Review</strong>
			<p class="contentTextDown">
				There is an ever-growing field of research to suggest best practices for accessibility within digital design, yet there seems to be a lesser focus on integrating accessibility into kiosks. We have sourced, reviewed, and synthesized several prior research papers that either touch on kiosk accessibility or an applicable field (e.g. web design). Some of the key takeaways from literature review are:<br>
				<ol class="contentTextDown">
				<li>There is a lot of research focusing on the idea of mechanical adjustments. Our approach will not be focused on that  but the idea that a <span class="unavColor">system can recognize and adapt to its user </span> is something to be considered.<br></li>
				<li>Many models exist that can be good reference points if we <span class="unavColor"> need to do an overall accessibility test of kiosks </span>, or understanding how other kiosks have improved physical accessibility.<br></li>
				<li>A good <span class="unavColor"> contextual enquiry can be very insightful </span> - they are not only able to correct the user flow but are also able to add additional features.</li><br><br></ol>
			</p>




				<strong class="topHeading unavColor">Observation and Task Analysis</strong>
				<p class="contentTextDown">

				In order to better understand how users interact with the current system, we decided to observe users interacting with the kiosk during lunch hour at NCR. Though our target user group consists of those with disabilities, we found it important to observe all users who might interact with our system. Any design that targets those with physical disabilities will also affect how others interact with the system.<br>
				Our goal with observation was mostly exploratory and built off of our task analysis. We <span class="unavColor">wanted to determine if users experienced difficulty with any point of the ordering process </span> due to usability issues. Additionally, we aimed to explore baseline data on the learnability of the kiosk interface. In short, <span class="unavColor"> we wanted to know how a novice user interacts with the system compared to a user that has been familiar with the system for some time </span>. We felt this was an important step in deciding how users of different experience levels interacted with the system, and we rationalized that we could use this information to inform design decisions in subsequent stages.<br><br></p>

				A task analysis allowed us to <span class="unavColor"> familiarize ourselves with the overall feel of the system, understand interactions from a high level, and prompted us to understand the limitations of the system for those with physical disabilities.</span> We performed one to primarily learn about the user flow and the decision-making process of a user as they interact with the XK32 kiosk. The ordering process on the XK32 kiosk can involve many steps from start to completion, so it was necessary to understand how these steps connected to one another and how a user typically navigates from the start screen to order completion, and follows them during the entire ordering process. By understanding how the system currently operates, we were able to form a baseline on which we could develop further research efforts.<br><br>

					‍We decided to conduct a semi-structured one-on-one interview as our first research method involving a physically disabled user within the problem space.

Our understanding prior to the interview was that not all kiosks were designed with wheelchair height in mind for usability.

					Beyond this, we wanted to determine specific pain points that our interviewee had with kiosk accessibility. We also wanted to know what public technologies they currently found helpful, whether or not it was implemented in point of sale kiosks. We also went into the interview with the idea that we could potentially narrow down our user group if given the opportunity.

									<li>The initial welcome screen indicates that the user should “Tap anywhere to begin,” but does not mention the uNav system.</li>
									
									<li>Though many users will never have any reason, or interest, in using the uNav, the lack of recognition of the feature might dissuade those with physical disabilities from approaching the kiosk in the first place.</li>

							<li><span class="unavColor">Users did not notice that there were more options to certain menu items due to the scroll bar being too light in contrast compared to the background.</span>

							</li><br>

							<li><span class="unavColor">Users became frustrated with the slow movement and interaction controls of the uNav device.</span>
								<ul><li>Users noted that they felt the uNav was cumbersome to use - both in how slowly it tracked across the screen and how some interactions required significant dexterity to successfully perform. For instance, in order to scroll down the screen, the user must place the cursor on the scroll bar and hold down two buttons at the same time (the enter button and up or down) to facilitate scrolling.</li></ul>

							</li><br>

							Other insights were less direct in their relevance to the XK32 kiosk, but were of enough significance to be considered for future design directions. Namely:<br><br>


							<li><span class="unavColor">Users want to remain independent, and not made to feel “special.”</span>
								<ul><li>This was explicitly stated during the interview and was an underlying subject from many survey respondents. In developing design solutions, it will be important to address how an accessibility feature will be perceived and, if possible, how it might be used universally.</li></ul>
							</li><br>
							
							<li><span class="unavColor">Feedback is important.</span>
								<ul><li>Many users with physical impairments also suffer from lack of feeling difficult in the movement of their extremities. As such, means of feedback other than visual will be considered.</li></ul>

						<p class="sectionHeading"><strong>CONCEPT EVALUATION</strong></p>


						<p class="contentTextDown">

							‍The first feedback session was designed for the perspective of an expert in the field of assistive technology. The set of questions from the first feedback session are <span class="unavColor"> intended for accessibility experts to review and identify obvious issues of our design concepts </span> based on their experience with working with people with accessibility needs. We planned on leveraging the feedback we obtained from first feedback round to help make decision on which concept and features to take forward.<br>

							From there, the final design concept can be developed into a detailed wireframe that can be tested by user tasks. <span class="unavColor">The second round of feedback session was done with our stakeholder, NCR,  in order to work towards our ultimate goal of achieving better accessibility of the NCR kiosk for wheelchair users.</span> This round was designed to understand users’ performance and opinions towards the system and for us to resolve issues discovered early so the later prototyping phase can move more smoothly.<br>

						</p><br>


						<p><strong>Feedback Session 1 Design - Sketches</strong></p>

						

						<p class="contentTextDown">
							<strong class="unavColor">Goals</strong><br>
							After fully defining our concepts and developing sketches to represent them, we began developing our first feedback session.  At this point we wanted to present our concepts at a relatively low fidelity to allow for feedback with original and creative ideas for improvement.  <span class="unavColor">The goal of this feedback session was to provide usability experts with a broad understanding of the three concepts we created in order to obtain feedback on the idea as a whole, and for certain features within the idea.</span>  For each concept we wanted to understand the following:<br>
							<ul class="contentTextDown">
								<li>The value each feature adds to the overall design</li>
								<li>Preferences for specific features within the concept and why</li>
								<li>Potential changes or improvements that may strengthen the concept</li>
							</ul></p>

							<!-- <p class="contentTextDown">
								<strong class="unavColor">Participants</strong><br>
								Our initial plan was to conduct this first session in person with our user group.  <span class="unavColor">Due to limited access to our user group, we had to divert to accessibility design experts.</span>  Sourcing participants to meet in person has been a continuous issue for our team, as well as for NCR who was only able to find two wheelchair users in Atlanta through a paid sourcing company.  We decided that accessibility design experts were the next best option because their experience and feedback would be relevant and valuable while our designs were still at concept level.
							</p>

							<p class="contentTextDown">
								<strong class="unavColor">Logistics</strong><br>
								Due to timing and professors’ schedules, <span class="unavColor">we decided to use qualtrics to gather feedback online for this session.</span>  We had success gathering concept feedback this way in our HCI foundations course, and were able to design this session in a similar fashion.<br>
								We structured the session the same way we would have for an in-person session.  We planned for this session to take approximately 45 minutes to allow for thorough and well thought out feedback.  Our session breakdown was as follows:

								<ul class="contentTextDown">
									<li>Describe our project goals, explain prior research and findings done to this point, and provide context (15 min)</li>
									<li>Present the participant each concept individually (5 min per concept)
										<ul>
											<li>Provide low to mid fidelity sketches of the design</li>
											<li>Explain and highlight important concept features for the design</li>
											<li>Give 1 or 2 example scenarios explaining how and when the concept would be used</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Present users with relevant questions for feedback (5 min per concept)</li>
								</ul></p><br> -->


								<p class="contentTextDown">
									<strong class="unavColor">Concept Refinement</strong><br>
									After analyzing our expert feedback results and speaking with NCR, we decided to pursue concept 2 (uNav Compatibility Mode) as a basis, and incorporate features from other concepts. <span class="unavColor">From a user’s perspective, concept 2 most significantly addresses the accessibility issues presented during the initial observation. From a stakeholder’s perspective, the proposed concept is a companion to the already existing uNav control, and might be considered as an evolution of this system. <br><br></span>
									<!-- Compared to the other concepts, concept 2 presented significant advantages like:
									<ul class="contentText2">
										<li>Hardware solutions are difficult to implement, concept 1 focused heavily on a new hardware interface in the form of an NFC Chip and a backend database management system which stores all user profiles. Concept 2 does not require any additional hardware requirements and uses only user interface changes to augment the present interactions.</li>
										<li>Through our initial requirements gathering sessions, we realized that users preferred tangible interactions. Concept 1 and Concept 3 did not account for tangible interactions but relied on touch screen for user input. Concept 2 leveraged the existing accessibility system - uNav to provide richer and faster interactions.</li>
										<li>Concept 1 targeted users on an individual level and concept 3 was for a universal population. Concept 2 targeted out audience (wheelchair users) directly and appealed to their need of an interface designed taking with respect to their needs.
										Concept 2 also directly helps solve the reach and dexterity issues through uNav, improving overall accessibility.</li>
										<li>Concept 2 is also compatible with the next generation of Kiosks by NCR. The next generation of kiosks have a handheld uNav which can be taken out of the Kiosks and can be used at a distance. This idea will solve the major limitation of uNav - limited viewing angle. Once the user is at a distance, a greater viewing angle with give the user access to the whole screen.</li>
									</ul> -->

								<p><strong>Feedback Session 2 Design - Wireframes</strong></p>

								</div>

								<br><br>
								<p class="contentTextDown">
									<strong class="unavColor">Goals</strong><br>
									Following the feedback from the concepts, we chose to take a deeper look at the uNav compatibility feature by generating mid-fidelity wireframes. <span class="unavColor">These wireframes were constructed with the intent to inform a user of how they might navigate through the ordering process from a high level, what the information structure would look like (e.g. information hierarchy and element size and placement), and how certain features might influence their experience (e.g. tab indexing and highlighting selected elements). </span> From this session we wanted to understand the following:<br>
									<ul class="contentTextDown">
										<li>Relevant opinions towards the overall design</li>
										<li>Preferences for specific features within the concept and justification</li>
										<li>Potential changes or improvements that can be considered for the system</li>
									</ul></p>

									<!-- <p class="contentTextDown">
										<strong class="unavColor">Participants</strong><br>
										Similar to the feedback session for sketches, we wanted to hold this feedback session in person with our user group.  Again, this was not possible due to the access and time constraints of this assignment.  Our next best option was to receive stakeholder feedback from NCR.  Their <span class="unavColor"> feedback at this stage in the design would be helpful to understand the feasibility of the concept and how well it may fit into the existing system. </span> From this we could develop relevant design changes and suggestions to make the concept with better within their current framework.  They may also have feedback on similar features or elements they have tried in the past and why they did or did not work. Beyond this, having mid-fidelity wireframes would allow NCR to understand and visualize ideas we had previously discussed.


									</p>

									<p class="contentTextDown">
										<strong class="unavColor">Logistics</strong><br>
										We designed this session to be conducted in person at NCR’s HQ with one or two NCR employees.  Our meetings often fluctuate between one and two employees, so we wanted to prepare for both situations.  We planned on having access to a meeting room with a large TV.  This would allow us to project our wireframes to a large size, similar to the size they would be on an XK32 kiosk.  We designed the session to take approximately 45 minutes with the following breakdown:

										<ul class="contentTextDown">
											<li>Describe the previous three concepts and explain why we chose the specific concept we did.  Also explain how the concept has evolved since the initial idea (15 min)</li>
											<li>Go through each wireframe and explain the interactions between each frame (15 min)
												<ul>
													<li>Cover relevant features</li>
													<li>Get feedback on interactions</li>
													<li>Take note on hesitations and confusion</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>Provide users with relevant questions for feedback (15 min)</li>
										</ul></p><br> -->


										<p class="contentTextDown">
											<strong class="unavColor">Prototype Design</strong><br>
											Based on our feedback sessions on the sketch concepts and wireframes, we can make certain improvements to the current design shown in section 06. Regarding accessibility considerations, the entire concept is designed to address usability concerns that those with physical disabilities might face when using the kiosk. For this reason, all of the usability refinements mentioned below are designed with accessibility in mind.

										<p class="contentTextDown">
											<span class="unavColor">We created three high fidelity prototypes using Figma for online collaboration and each prototype would serve its own purpose for different task-based analyses.</span> All of the prototypes begin with a welcome screen, which indicates that the user can begin their interaction by either tapping the screen or pressing a button on the uNav. It is important to note that we did not have the means of connecting a physical uNav control device to the prototype, and so simulated it on screen within the prototype itself. <span class="unavColor">The point of this prototype is not to focus on the input methods of the physical device, but the output of what the uNav control leverages, which is the tab-indexing functionality.</span> Therefore, we felt that an onscreen uNav was adequate in representing our intentions and research goals of the prototype.

										<!-- <strong class="unavColor">Improved Feedback and Situational Awareness</strong><br>
							
										A few of the primary pain points that our user group indicated during research was a lack of awareness of: (1) how to use the uNav control (or the fact that it even existed), and (2) where the cursor was at certain points during the ordering process. For this reason, we incorporated tab-indexing into the design and removed the “free range” cursor control entirely. <br>
										Additionally, we added a highlight on the selected element to better orient the user as to where they are on the screen. This is emphasized by giving the selectable elements a drop shadow, and non-interactive elements remaining flat on the screen.


										<br><br>
										<strong class="unavColor">Restructured User Flow and Element Placement</strong><br>

										To better promote the function of tab-indexing, we increased the size of the meal elements on the right of the screen, and placed the elements in a grid-like structure, so that they can simply tap up, down, left, or right to change their selection. Once an element is selected (in this case, a sandwich), the user is presented with tertiary options (e.g. size of sandwich). Pressing the center button on the uNav control confirms the selection and adds it to the user’s cart.<br>

										The selectable elements are oriented on the left-hand side of the screen, and indicate to the user where they are at in the ordering process. This orientation of information provides flexibility in how the user can create their meal. They are free to jump around to different parts of the meal, instead of following a set path, as before.<br>

										Previously, users needed to precisely navigate to the element via uNav cursor control, which could result in missed presses and clunky and cumbersome input. Our intention with this part of the redesign is to improve the speed and accuracy of selecting an element.</p> -->

										Because we did not have access to an XK32 kiosk for user testing, we set up a monitor on its side (shown below) which closely represented the actual size of a real XK32 Kiosk. Further, as previously mentioned, we simulated the uNav interaction by including a d-pad style control on screen, which the user was able to control with a mouse.

										<br><br>
										<strong class="unavColor">Expert Testing: Cognitive Walkthrough</strong><br>

										We chose to do a cognitive walkthrough to evaluate out prototype and <span class="unavColor"> weed out the common mistakes in the interface </span>. We used three cohorts from the HCI program as usability experts and asked them to perform a task on our prototype. Rather than just knowing the overall experience, we were able to pinpoint issues on individual screen/interactions. <!-- We asked the experts to perform one task with focus on the unav interactions. They were asked to order a medium caesar salad and sweet potato chips from Segovia Coffee Co (dine-in). They were also asked to explore through the drinks and extras menu and not find anything relevant to their order.  -->Information goals of our cognitive walkthrough testing were:

										<ul class="contentTextDown">
											<li>Observability: Can the users understand which stage they are in the ordering process and the numbers of steps needed to complete the order? Can the users identify where their cursor is on the screen and where can it go?</li>
											<li>Learnability: How easy it is for first-time users to complete the food ordering process within the new user interface with uNav keypad?</li>
											<li>Predictability: Can the users understand where their cursor can go before actually pressing them? Can the users understand the visual cues to predict the logic flow of tab indexing?</li>
											<li>Experience: Are users satisfied with the overall ordering experience?</li>
										</ul>

										</p><br>

										<p class="contentTextDown">

										<strong class="unavColor">Results</strong><br>

										We received the following Quantitative Usability Specification Ratings on a scale of 1-5:<br>
										(1 = highly disagree, 5 = highly agree)

										<br><br><img src="unav-chart-1.svg" class="middleImg" width="60%"><br><br>
										
										Here is the summary of the Qualitative Feedback:

										<ul class="contentTextDown">

										<li> Images are clickable - not obvious</li>
										<li> Some buttons are small</li>
										<li> Menus aren’t aligned well with other interactive items on the screen </li>
										<li> Visibility issues with how many steps are left in the ordering process </li>
										<li> Child menu is not obvious/clear - Heirarchy Issue </li>
										<li> Pay screen is different from the rest of the system </li>
										<li> Learning curve at first, then the tab indexing is intuitive </li>
										<li> Hierarchy is not obvious between parent and child menu </li>
										<li> There is no obvious back button </li>

										<p class="contentTextDown">
										
										<strong class="unavColor">User Testing: Moderated Task-based Usability Testing</strong><br>

										We chose to do moderated task-based usability testing with users to determine <span class="unavColor">  how well the interface is integrating with the uNav keypad as an accessibility feature </span> for input during the food ordering and checking out process. Also, we want to collect data on users’ performance for examining the logic flow of tab indexing and get feedback on content, functionality and visual layout. We conducted 9 in-person single-participant sessions. Information goals of our user testing include:



										<ul class="contentTextDown">
											<li>Learnability: How easy it is for first-time users to complete the food ordering process within the new user interface with uNav keypad?</li>
											<li>Predictability: Can the users understand the visual cues to predict the logic flow of tab indexing?</li>

											<li>Recoverability: How easy it is for first-time users to cover their errors with the help of system functionality?</li>
											<li>Satisfaction: Are users satisfied with how the system allows them to complete food ordering and modifying tasks?</li>

										<strong class="unavColor">Results</strong><br>

										We received the following Quantitative Usability Specification Ratings on a scale of 1-5:<br>
										(1 = highly disagree, 5 = highly agree)

										<br><br><img src="unav-chart-2.svg" class="middleImg" width="60%"><br><br>
										
										Here is the summary of System-wide Recommendations:

										<ul class="contentTextDown">

										<li> Improve parent-child menu visual hierarchy</li>
										<li> Incorporate a “back” button or similar function</li>
										<li> Decrease use of green color throughout system to emphasize highlighted elements better</li>
										<li> Refine visual linear relationships between interactive elements</li>
										<li> Emphasize or add system status indicators to display order progress </li>
										
										</ul>



										<p class="contentTextDown">Here is the summary of other user feedback: </p>

										<ul class="contentTextDown">

										<li>The side navigation bar is not clearly state the relationship between each stage of the ordering process.</li>
										<li>The side navigation bar did not clearly indicate the parent and child relationship of the main and sub navigation selections.</li>
										<li> The progress navigation bar is not telling the users there is an option to go back. </li>
										<li> Highlight tab box is not visually emphasized enough for first-time users to understand and recognize. </li>
										<li> Pay button seems out of place, not obvious and disconnected with the whole progress navigation. </li>
										<li> Menu plus icon is suggesting extra interaction on itself. </li>
										<li> The change design of review page makes it disconnected from the rest. </li>
										<li> The cart icon is not useful but visually distracting. </li>
										<li> The information about selected items is out of view and hard to distinguish from the today’s special menu. </li>
										<li> Users don’t know how to get to the side functional buttons.</li>
										<li> The system is offering too much freedom for users to explore and users can be confused about what to do. </li>

										</ul>
										
										
										</p><br>


										<p class="contentTextDown">Apart from all the issues mentioned above, we found that the level of usability and visual representation was satisfactory and the task flow is easy to follow. We found participant reception to our prototype to be positive, and most issues could be solved with some UI changes and building a detailed information heirarchy.
										<span class="unavColor"> NCR is satisfied with the overall design recommendations and plans to keep them in mind while moving forward in the developement of the XK32 Kiosk.  </span></p>
