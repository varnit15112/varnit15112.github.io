We wanted to know which features seemed attractive and useful to users and which ones felt obsolete to them. We <span class="sherpaColor"> received 44 responses and evaluated which features overcame initial pain points and were appreciated by the users.</span>

						‍Our final solution contains most parts of Concept 1 - Sherpa and one part of Concept 2 - NorthStar. We realized that not a lot of users will want to pay for an expert's advice, they would rather take their bicycle to the shop; so we removed the expert advice feature. We also noticed that users do not carry tools all the time so we integrated the Repair Station Locator feature from NorthStart to display public repair stations.<br><br></p>

						To summarize: <span class="sherpaColor"><i>Sherpa provides users with a step by step repair guide, which helps users perform repairs through visual and audio instructions. Additionally, it uses augmented reality to help users recognize unknown parts and a public repair station locator for users who do not have the necessary repair tools.</i></span><br><br><br>

							Below is a mid-fidelity prototype that was built with Sketch, and it will be used to gauge initial feedback. We chose to produce a mid-fidelity prototype as a starting point, as it will be easy to refine and iterate without getting bogged down by aesthetic and low-level detail considerations. However, given our short time to complete this project, we have started developing an aesthetic direction as well, of which a few core screens are visualized in the previous section.

							Our users will likely be implementing our mobile app on a smartphone, and as such, we have used a program (Sketch) that will allow us to push the interactive prototype to an iPhone. We want to gauge the effectiveness of this prototype at discovering and solving problems with maintenance, and will include enough information in the prototype to allow the participant to have a sense of how this will help them with the aforementioned tasks. <br>
						Though the entire prototype has been built out to show the majority of screen interactions, some paths of the prototype are more valuable to our purposes of user testing than others. For our purposes, we will identify a task (in this case, it is a flat tire) that we want the user to complete, and ask them to first diagnose the problem until they discover it and the app confirms that this is the correct problem. Within the diagnosis process, they will utilize the part identification feature to recognize and confirm that their tire has low air pressure. Once confirmed, they will indicate that they do not have the appropriate tools to complete the task, and will then be directed to the repair station locator. From here, they will identify which repair station to use, then determine if it has the appropriate tools to inflate their tire. Finally, they will be walked through a simplified version of the repair. </p><br>

						<p class="contentTextDown"> 
							<!-- In our evaluation, we planned three evaluation methods: Usability Expert Review, Bike Mechanic Review, and Usability Testing.  -->Due to limited time and resources, we had to perform a discount evaluation, we chose to do the <span class="sherpaColor"> Usability Expert Review, but with the inclusion of task-based evaluation to make the review more holistic. </span> Each session involved two to three people: the evaluator, the facilitator, and an additional note taker. We created a high fidelity prototype (shown below) to test our proposed solution. We split our evaluation into two parts, the usability expert review and task-based evaluation.<br>
							<strong>Participants</strong>- Five HCI cohorts who have been trained to evaluate a design considering usability specifications

						<p class="contentTextDown">
						<strong class="topHeading sherpaColor">Usability Expert Review</strong><br>
						We decided this evaluation method should be completed first because it is a hierarchical process that will <span class="sherpaColor"> quickly reveal obvious flaws in our design </span>.  Also given the scope of this project, it is much less resource-intensive compared to usability testing with our user group.
						
						<!-- Initially, the facilitator gave the evaluator an overview of the system and provided context including the user goals, concept features, and relevant scenarios. Once the facilitator felt that they had a good understanding of the concept, the evaluator was asked to freely navigate through the home, profile, and bike selector sections of the system. We asked the evaluator to think aloud while going through the design to understand their thought process and probe better insights. Here we wanted the evaluator to cover different features each time they went through the system and become familiar with the layout. -->
						<span class="sherpaColor"> Each evaluator had to consider the system for the usability specifications- Consistency, Customizability, Recoversability, Observability, and Responsiveness.</span>
						</p><br>


						
						<p class="contentTextDown">
							<strong class="topHeading sherpaColor ">Task-Based Evaluation</strong><br>
							After the usability expert review section was complete the evaluators moved onto the task-based evaluation. The evaluators went through each task described above and again were instructed to think aloud to describe their thought process. <span class="sherpaColor">  We asked questions from the participant after each task and avoided giving instructions during the task. </span> After the final task was completed the participants were asked a few questions to further evaluate the design.
							<!-- The task-based evaluation was included to make our evaluation more holistic.  We used the usability experts we recruited to go through tasks that did not involve repairing a bicycle and was considered the second part of our evaluation session.  Including this helped to evaluate the logic of our system and its features, as well as the information architecture. --> We asked our participants three tasks that a typical user would perform:<br>
							<ul class="contentTextDown"> 
							<li>Task 1: Diagnose your flat tire<br></li>
							<li>Task 2: Find a nearby repair station<br></li>
							<li>Task 3: Complete the repair process<br></li>
							</ul>
						</p><br>

						<strong class="topHeading sherpaColor">Results</strong>
						<p class="contentTextDown">
							We used the qualitative data to rank the priority of issues that need to be addressed. We received the following scored on a scale of 1-5:<br>

							(1 = highly disagree, 5 = highly agree)

							<br>

							<!-- <ul class="contentTextDown">
							
							<li>Consistency		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 3.4<br>
							<li>Customizability	&nbsp;	- 4.2<br>
							<li>Recoversability	&nbsp;	- 3.4<br>
							<li>Observability	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 3.8<br>
							<li>Responsiveness	&nbsp;- 3.8<br><br>

							</ul> -->

							<br><br><img src="sherpa-chart.svg" class="middleImg" width="60%"><br><br>


							Once we compiled the qualitative data, we could see the changes that needed to be made on a whole as well as individual level. We saw that some areas (like Consistency) required a more work than others and<span class="sherpaColor"> our evaluation method enabled us to get not only task specific but also screen specific feedback. </span> <br><br>
							We found some general problems including the overall flow of the system and repair process, the ambiguity of icons and button layout, and visual inconsistency within the visual interface design. The feedback from experts suggests that there is a problem with information hierarchy where the whole application feels disconnected and some features are misplaced within the application. At the same time, even the overall flow is clear when experts were given several tasks to complete, there were issues about interaction (highly depending on prototyping tool) that cause problems on responsiveness and recoverability of the system. Apart from all the issues mentioned above, we found that the level of usability and visual representation was satisfactory and the task flow is easy to follow. <br><br>
							The data from the evaluation of the prototype was used inform ongoing refinement of the design. <span class="sherpaColor">Overall, we found participant reception to our prototype to be positive, and most issues could be solved with simple changes. </span>
