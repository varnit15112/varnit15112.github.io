        The NCR Corporation, previously known as National Cash Register,
        is a leading kiosk manufacturer whose products include
        different kinds of self service-kiosks, such as the XK32,
        the SK47, the SS75, and the SelfServ 90.
    </div>

        However, these Kiosk systems are not

        <span class="color3">At the same time, NCR has not been oblivious of
        accessibility and has implemented

      1. Literature Review
    </div>

    <div class="textContent">
        Since neither of us had any prior experience working with
        Kiosks, the first step in our research process was to go
        through existing literature. <span class="color3"> While there is an ever-growing
        field of research to suggest best practices for accessibility
        within digital design, we found out that there seems to be
        a lesser focus on integrating accessibility into kiosks. </span>
        We sourced, reviewed, and synthesized several research
        papers that either touch on kiosk accessibility or associated
        applicable field. Some of the key takeaways were:
        <ul>
            <li> A lot of research papers focus on mechanical
                adjustments to cater to different height requirements.
                Due to implementation and cost restrictions, we will
                not focus on that. However, <span class="color3">  the idea of a
                    system that
                adapts or transforms based on user needs is promising. </span>
            <li> There are many accessibility quantifiers which
                give an overall accessibility score, but there
                are few articles that suggest best practices.
            <li> <span class="color3"> Observation and task analysis are powerful
                tools </span> - they help in not only understanding the
                existing system but also give insight into the
                user's thought process.
        </ul>

    <div class="subheadingSection">
      2. Task Analysis
    </div>

    <div class="textContent">
        To better understand how users interact with the current system,
        we decided to observe users interacting with the kiosk at peak
        usage - the lunch hour. Our goal with observation was mostly
        exploratory, but with some research objectives. <span class="color3">
        We intended to
        build a task heirarchy of the existing system and determine if
        users experienced any usability issues with the ordering process. </span>
        Additionally, we wanted to know how a novice user interacts with
        the system compared to a user that has been familiar with the
        system for some time to determine learnability.

    <div class="textContent">
        Since we were dealing with a vulnerable population, we had
        access to a select people for in-person studies. We wanted
        to use surveys to gather information about user needs and
        pain points. However, <span class="color3"> before creating a survey without much
        domain knowledge, we decided to conduct a semi-structured
        interview as our first research method
        to understand the problem space better. </span>

        We were able to contact someone who advocates rights for
        people with physical disabilities across Atlanta. <span class="color3"> Our main
        information goal from this research method was to weed
        out obvious questions and get in-depth knowledge about
        the community's perception of Kiosks. We also wanted to
        know more about the technologies they found helpful in public spaces. </span>

    <div class="textContent">
        We chose an online survey as a research method to
        collect data primarily because of its ability to collect
        data from a large set of users in a short time. <span class="color3"> We wanted
        to learn what users with disabilities like and dislike about
        a point of sale kiosk. We wanted to know how users’ disabilities
        hinder specific interactions with a kiosk. </span> Based on our
        previous research methods, another goal for us was to learn
        about common frustrations at each stage of the process of
        completing checkout. We also wanted to determine if certain
        users prefer tactile interaction versus touch screen and for
        completing what tasks.

        From the task analysis, observation study,

        A few of the most straight-forward problems, and

        <ul>
            <li>Users did not notice that alternate methods of

            <li>Users did not notice that there were more

                bar being too light in contrast compared to the background.
            </li>
            <li>Certain areas of the screen are
                challenging for users with physical
                impairments to reach or see from where they are seated.
            </li>
            <li>Users became frustrated with the
                slow movement and interaction controls of the uNav device.
            </li>
            <li>Users were often unaware of how to add an
                item to cart before checkout
            </li>
            <li>Users want to remain independent, and not made to feel “special"
            </li>
            <li>Action feedback is important

    <div class="textContent">
        After fully defining our concepts and developing
        sketches to represent them, we began developing our
        first feedback session. At this point, we wanted to
        present our concepts at a relatively low fidelity to
        allow for feedback with original and creative ideas
        for improvement. The goal of this feedback session
        was to <span class="color3"> provide usability experts with a broad
        understanding of the three concepts we created
        to obtain feedback on the idea as a whole, and
        for certain features within the idea. </span>

        For each concept we wanted to understand the following: <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>The value each feature adds to the overall design</li>
            <li>Preferences for specific features within the concept and why</li>
            <li>Potential changes or improvements that may strengthen the concept</li>

        <span class="color3"> After speaking with usability experts from NCR,
        we decided to pursue concept 2 (uNav Compatibility Mode)
        as a basis, and incorporate features from other concepts. </span>
        From a user’s perspective, concept 2 most significantly
        addresses the accessibility issues presented during the
        initial observation. From a stakeholder’s perspective, the
        proposed concept is a companion to the already existing
        uNav control and will be considered as an evolution
        of the existing system.

        how they might navigate through the ordering process from a high level,
        what the information structure would look like (e.g. information hierarchy
        and element size and placement), and how certain features might influence
        their experience (e.g. tab indexing and highlighting selected elements). </span>
        Here are a few wireframes out of the many that were used for testing.

        We tested the above wireframes with our primary stakeholder,
        NCR, in the form of an open focus group discussion.
        We took notes from this session and captured valuable feedback and
        related suggestions. We can make certain improvements to the current design:<br><br>

        <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Information hierarchy</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Including adequate space between interactive elements</li>
                    <li>Separating elements  on screen by “interactive” and
                        “non-interactive” elements, so as to keep any touch point within a certain area</li>
                    <li>Presenting information (e.g. food items) in categories,
                        so as to minimize the amount of information present at any moment</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Input feedback</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Highlighting the element the user has currently selected</li>
                    <li>Visually distinguish between interactive and non-interactive elements</li>
                    <li>Increase contrast on certain existing elements (e.g. scroll bar) to improve recognizability</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Navigation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arranging elements in a grid-pattern to promote navigating through interactive elements by tab indexing</li>
                    <li>Incorporating “placeholder” elements that facilitate indexing,
                        but are non-interactive, to allow a user to more easily traverse the screen</li>
                    <li>Refining the navigation bar as a “tree” that better filters information</li>
                    <li>Displaying the current, previous, and next steps that a user will take to complete their order, to better</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Predictability</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Displaying current, previous, and next steps in the
                        navigation bar that will communicate where a user is in the ordering process, and how many more steps they need to take to complete their order</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

        Our group analyzed the feedback and incorporated the results in the high fidelity design.<br><br>

        <span class="color3"> We chose to do moderated task-based usability testing with
